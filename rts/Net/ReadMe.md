# Networking Component Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the networking components for the BumpStock Engine. The netcode is responsible for handling all network communication, multiplayer functionality, and real-time synchronization between game clients and servers.

## Structure
The networking system is organized into several key components:

- Connection Management: Handles client-server connections and connection states
- Packet Handling: Manages the sending and receiving of network packets
- State Synchronization: Ensures game state consistency across all connected clients
- Network Protocol: Implements the custom network protocol for efficient game data transmission

## Key Features
- Client-Server Architecture
- Real-time State Synchronization
- Reliable UDP Communication
- Network State Management
- Latency Compensation

## Usage
To implement networking in your game:

1. Initialize the network manager
2. Configure connection settings
3. Handle network events and callbacks
4. Implement state synchronization

## Best Practices
- Always validate network data
- Implement proper error handling
- Use bandwidth efficiently
- Consider latency in gameplay mechanics

## Dependencies
- Standard networking libraries
- Engine core components

## Configuration
Network settings can be configured through the engine's configuration system:
- Port settings
- Connection timeouts
- Packet sizes
- Update frequency

For detailed implementation examples and API documentation, please refer to the code comments in the individual files.
